# frontend-assessment
Frontend assessment project for FE candidates

## Project Instructions
Make an application that allows the user to view the forecasted daily weather conditions for a given location using any publicly available weather API.
You are free to use the frameworks and tools you prefer, however we strongly suggest you keep the hard skills of the job offer in mind.

## Minimal requirements
The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.

## Additional requirements
- You may choose any frameworks or templating libraries which you feel confortable with, React, Vue, Angular, etc.
- **Pay attention to semantics**: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care
- Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using CSS or your favourite CSS preprocessor
- Communicate with the API in a clean way, reusing as much of your code as possible

## Project submission
- submit your solution to a new branch on the same repository
- make sure you provide clear an flawless instructions on how to build and exectute your project
- assume nothing. Anyone should be able to follow your instructions and execute your project right out of the box
- send an email to your recruiter or jose.porto@teldoc.eu once you've completed the task

## Timing
The time restrictions varies with each case and candidate's availability. You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but make sure what you create is good. There's good code done in one hour, and good code done in one week. We take this in consideration.

## Do you still have questions?
Send an email to jose.porto@teldoc.eu if you feel you don't have enough information to proceed.
